# React Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio project I built while learning **React.js**.  
The goal of this project was to understand the fundamentals of React and practice building a fully functional, modern web app from scratch.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The portfolio showcases:
- A landing/home page with an introduction
- About section with my background
- Projects section highlighting some work
- Contact form for reaching out

It uses **React components, props, state, and routing** to structure the app.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **React.js** (Functional Components & Hooks)
- **React Router** (for navigation)
- **CSS / Tailwind** (for styling)
- **Git & GitHub** (for version control)

## 📖 What I Learned
This project was a hands-on way to learn React.  
Some key takeaways:
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Breaking the UI into reusable components (Navbar, Footer, ProjectCard, etc.).
- **Props & State Management**: Passing data between components and managing dynamic content.
- **React Router**: Setting up navigation without full page reloads.
- **JSX Syntax**: Writing HTML-like code inside JavaScript.
- **Styling in React**: Using CSS modules/Tailwind and inline styles.
- **Deployment**: Hosting the project online (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel).
